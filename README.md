# Study Helper Circular Linked List

The purpose of this program is to represent a group of study materials to review.  
There are three different types of study material; a text book to read, a set of slides to review and a list of questions to practice.  
All pieces of study material have a type, the name of the class, and  a category they are associated with.  
Yet different study materials have other pieces of data unique to itself.  
The textbook has a title of the book. The slides have a file location of where the slides are located.  
The list of questions has head and tail pointer for the list of questiions as well as knowing how many questions are in the list.  
The list of questions are represented using a linear linked list.  
To keep all of the study materials together a circluar linked list of study materials is used.  
The CLL can add more study materials, remove study materials and display the study material's based on a given condition, such as their name or type.
